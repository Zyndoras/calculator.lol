# Calculator in LOLCODE

This is just me fumbling with LOLCODE.

"Future" additions of [LCI](https://github.com/justinmeza/lci) are needed to function properly.

## Usage

```bash
$ lci calculator.lol
CAN I HAZ CALCULESHUN?
$ 30.4 - 12
30.4 - 12 = 18.40
```

Requires spaces between input parameters.
